# Excel_Kickstart_My_Chart

Goal:
Organize and analyze 4,000 past Kickstarter projects in order to discover trends and gain insight as to why some Kickstarters fail and others succeed.

Process:
Used conditional formatting to color-code project states and percentage of project funded in order to easily see the progress of each project. 

Used formulas to calculate the average donation amount of each project, convert Unix timestamps, and split cells into new columns by specified delimiter.

Created pivot tables and pivot charts to analyze the relationship between success rates and parent-category, sub-category, and launch dates.
